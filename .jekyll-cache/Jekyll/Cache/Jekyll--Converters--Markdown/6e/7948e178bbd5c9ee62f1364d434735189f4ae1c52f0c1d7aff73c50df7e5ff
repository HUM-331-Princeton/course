<h2 id="files-and-folders-you-will-need-to-edit-to-build-your-site">Files and folders you <em>will</em> need to edit to build your site:</h2>
<p><strong>congif.yml</strong>: This file collects the basic info for your site. You’ll simply <strong>fill it out once</strong> (and you should do this with your partner when you begin your project), and then you will likely never touch this file again.</p>

<p><strong>people</strong>: The folder where you’ll put your author bio pages. There’s a sample one in here to get you started. You already know how to customize one for yourself, because you did it for our course blog.</p>

<p><strong>posts</strong>: The folder where you’ll put your posts, if you have them. You already know how to create new posts and load them into this folder. They’ll automatically show up on your homepage, if you decide to leave the format of your homepage as a blog feed. However, you may decide not to present your work in blog format, though you certainly can if you’d like.</p>

<p><strong>404.md</strong>: A custom 404 page for your site! If a link is broken, this is what will pop up. You can edit the file with whatever you’d like.</p>

<p><strong>index.md</strong>: This is the homepage of your site. Right now it’s set up as a feed of blog posts. You can keep it that way, or you can add information about your project as a landing page. Or you can remove the blog feed all together!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These are the only two <strong>pages</strong> that are mandatory for your site. You can delete the <strong>about.md</strong> file if you don’t want to have an “About” page for your project in addition to your home page, but it’s probably a good idea to have one. You can also create as many new pages for your site as you’d like and customize them as you see fit. See directions below!</p>

<h2 id="files-and-folders-that-you-may-chose-to-edit-when-building-your-site">Files and folders that you <em>may</em> chose to edit when building your site:</h2>

<p><strong>layouts</strong>: This folder contains the basic HTML that serves as the template for the different categories of pages on your site. Jekyll takes the Markdown content of your individual posts or pages and then styles them according to the HTML templates laid out in this folder. That’s why these files are all written in HTML. If you’d like to play around with the basic layout of your site, you’ll need to edit these pages using HTML. You certainly don’t have to–these pages will work fine just as they are–but if you’d like to, there are basic HTML tutorials available for free on the web, like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">this one</a> from CodeAcademy which is very good. It includes the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>author.html</strong>: The template for contributor bio pages that will automatically search and update a list of posts you’ve created. You won’t need to tinker with this.</li>
  <li><strong>default.html</strong>: Contains the layout you want to appear on <em>every single page of your website</em>: header and footer, nav, and some meta-data script. If you want to fiddle with the layout of your masthead or footer, you’d do it in this file.</li>
  <li><strong>page.hmtl</strong>: The basic layout for any .md file designated as “page” in the header. You shouldn’t need to tinker with this, but who knows, you might!</li>
  <li><strong>post.html</strong>: The basic layout for any .md file designated as “post” in the header. Not much here to fiddle with, but you may want to.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>style.scss</strong>: This is the file that contains the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code to change how your site looks (fonts, colors, positioning of text blocks and images). If you want to make design layout changes to your site, this is where you do it. However, this isn’t a web design course, and I’m not grading you on the aesthetics of your site, so don’t feel obligated. We will go over a couple of places where you can easily make basic changes to colors and fonts, but there is no expectation that you will go beyond that. If you’d like to learn more about CSS <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css">this free lesson</a> from CodeAcademy is also very good.</p>

<p><strong>sidebar.html</strong> in the <strong>includes</strong> folder: This is the html file that contains the layout for the sidebar navigation. The only thing you’d ever need to edit is to add an additional navigation link or to take one away. (Instructions on how to do so below.)</p>

<p><strong>variables.scss</strong> within the <strong>sass</strong> folder: This is the file you would edit if you wanted to change the universal color schemes or font stacks for your site. (Instructions on how to do so below.)</p>

<h2 id="the-following-files-and-folders-are-part-of-the-basic-structure-of-our-site-and-dont-need-to-be-edited-by-you">The following files and folders are part of the basic structure of our site and <em>don’t need to be edited</em> by you:</h2>
<p><strong>includes</strong>: Folder with html pages for the extra goodies that came with this template, like social media icons and Google analytics. The only thing you’ll ever need to touch in here is the sidebar.html file.</p>

<p><strong>sass</strong>: The CSS files for the extra material that comes along with the site. The only thing you might touch in here is the <strong>variables.scc</strong> file to change the basic colors and fonts of your site.</p>

<p><strong>site</strong>: This is where Jekyll keeps all the files created when it builds your site from your Markdown files and translated them to HTML. You don’t ever need to touch anything in this folder. All of these files will constantly change as you develop your site.</p>

<p><strong>LICENSE, README, and script.js</strong> are all files that you shouldn’t touch. The license comes from the original writer of Jekyll Now (it’s totally open access), and the README file (which you’re reading now) simply explains the repository to interested parties on GitHub. Finally, the script.js file contains the code for the sliding navigation sidebar.</p>

<h1 id="workflow-for-using-atom-to-build-your-site">Workflow for using Atom to build your site</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Open Atom, select <strong>Reopen a project repository,</strong> select your repository.</li>
  <li>Be sure you are working you your own branch, <strong>firstname-MM-DD</strong> and not the <strong>master</strong> branch.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Fetch</strong> in the bottom right to be sure your local files match the ones in the remote repository. If there are changed files, click <strong>Pull</strong> to pull them into your local repository.</li>
  <li>Always be sure to <strong>Save</strong> the files (Control+S or Command+S) and then toggle the <strong>Git</strong> menu (bottom right) to <strong>Stage your changes</strong>, <strong>Commit your changes</strong>, and then, at the end of your work session, <strong>Push your changes</strong> to the repository on the web.</li>
  <li>After several work sessions, when you’ve got your files where you want them and you’d like to compare your work with your partner, you’ll go to the web and open your repository on github.com. You’ll create a <strong>pull request</strong> to merge your <strong>name-MM-DD branch</strong> with the <strong>main branch</strong>.</li>
  <li>You and your partner will meet to discuss changes and to merge pull requests.</li>
  <li>Once you approve and merge those changes, your individual branch no longer exists. It’s been incorporated into the main branch.</li>
  <li>Next time you open Atom, select <strong>main</strong> in the branch menu (bottom right) and click <strong>Fetch</strong> to sync your local files with those on the web. Then click <strong>Pull</strong> to pull in the changed files.</li>
  <li>To keep working on the files in the site, repeat this workflow by <strong>creating a new individual branch</strong> following the <strong>name-MM-DD</strong> format (but remember, you only need to create a new branch after you’ve merged your old one with a pull request). This helps you to quickly see that you’re working in the latest branch when you open Atom. Repeat these steps over and over again until you’ve built your final project.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="how-to-create-new-pages-for-your-final-project-site">How to Create New Pages for your Final Project Site</h1>
<p>Create a new .md file in your repository–the root directory of your site–and, in the header info at the top, set it to:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: page
title: Your Title Here
---
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Unlike <strong>posts</strong>, pages don’t automatically show up on your site. You need to create links within your site so that users can access them. You may want some of these links to exist in the Navigation menu on the sidebar. If so, you’ll need to edit the navigation links in the <strong>sidebar.html</strong> file. You may just want to link to new pages through other pages, and that’s also just fine.</p>

<p>Maybe instead of an “About” page, you want a page called “History” in your navigation menu. So here’s how you make one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new .md file in your repository (not within a folder, just in the repository) called <strong>history.md</strong>.</li>
  <li>Use the header settings above, and write the page in Markdown as you would any blog post. Save your changes.</li>
  <li>Open the <strong>includes</strong> folder, and then open <strong>sidebar.html</strong>. This file has the template for the navigation bar with this HTML within it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;nav class=”sidebar-nav”&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a class=”sidebar-nav-item” href="/course/"&gt;HOME&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a class=”sidebar-nav-item” href="/course/about"&gt;ABOUT&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just change it to:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;nav class=”sidebar-nav”&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a class=”sidebar-nav-item” href="/course/"&gt;HOME&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a class=”sidebar-nav-item” href="/course/history"&gt;HISTORY&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Note that you’ve changed both the link itself from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/course/about</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/course/history</code> <em>and</em> the text that appears in the sidebar, from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABOUT</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HISTORY</code>.</p>

<p>In both HTML and in Markdown, you can use this exact formula anytime you want to add a link to other pages <em>held within your site</em> (this includes links to files of images or PDFS that you might want to save in a folder in your site too):</p>

<p>HTML: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href=”/course/filename”&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>Markdown: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Link Text](/course/filename)</code></p>

<p>If you’re trying to link to, say, an image file in a folder, or a PDF file in a folder, you would follow the same format, just including the folder extension before the file:</p>

<p>For a link to a PDF:</p>

<p>HTML: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href=”/course/folder/filename”&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>Markdown: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Link Text](/course/folder/filename)</code></p>

<p>For a link to an image file stored in your repository:</p>

<p>HTML:  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img src=”/course/folder/filename” /&gt;</code></p>

<p>Markdown: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![Alt Text](/course/folder/filename)</code></p>

<h1 id="how-to-edit-the-fonts-or-colors-of-your-site">How to edit the fonts or colors of your site</h1>

<p>Both of these attributes of your site should be changed at the “all site” level in the <strong>_variables.scss</strong> file (which is within the <strong>_sass</strong> folder). In that file, you’ll see a list of existing colors for the site, as well as an existing list of fonts. You can add to either list by simply creating a name for your new color or font and adding the value. Then use the name you’ve created anywhere you want to change the color or font in your <strong>style.scss</strong> file.</p>

<h2 id="to-import-and-change-a-font-family">To import and change a font family:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Find a font you like on <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google fonts</a> and click “Select this style.” You should see a sidebar menu pop up with information for how to embed that font family into your web project. (If not click the icon that looks like three boxes and a plus sign in the upper right menu bar.)</li>
  <li>You’ll see two options under <strong>Use on the web</strong>. Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@import</code> rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;link&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>Copy the text <strong>in between</strong> the two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;style&gt;</code> tags. Just the text in the middle!</li>
  <li>In your <strong>_variables.scss</strong> file, paste that text at the bottom of the file. <strong>Be sure the line of text ends with a semicolon.</strong></li>
  <li>Go back to the Google fonts page and copy the text in the box labeled <strong>CSS rules to specify families</strong> (just the text <em>after</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">font-family:</code>)
Now, in the <strong>_variables.scss</strong> file, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//Font stacks</code> section, on a new line create a name for your new font with the dollar sign format:</li>
</ol>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$yourfontname:</code></p>

<p>Then paste in the text you copied from Google fonts, making sure the text ends with a semicolon.</p>

<p>Anytime you want to use that font, for a header or title or whatever, you’ll just change the font name in the <strong>style.scss</strong> file, usually from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$helvetica</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$helveticaNeue</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$yourfontname</code>.</p>

<h2 id="to-add-or-change-a-color">To add or change a color:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com">htmlcolorcodes.com</a> and use the Picker tool to fund a suite of colors that you like. You’ll see the six digit hex value of the color displayed beneath the color box.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>_variables.scss</strong> file, simply name that color something you’ll remember following the dollar sign first format, and then past the six digit color code in like so, making sure that the line of text ends in a semicolon:</li>
</ol>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$neonPink: #F561F5;</code></p>

<p>Whenever you want to use that color, just type the name, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$neonPink</code> or whatever, to replace whatever is in the <strong>style.scss</strong> sheet.</p>

<h1 id="finally-all-of-the-markdown-rules-apply-to-your-final-project-repository-too">Finally, all of the Markdown rules apply to your final project repository too.</h1>
<p>So be sure to consult the rules listed below!</p>

<h3 id="rule-1-all-of-the-markdown-syntax-you-learned-from-the-getting-started-with-markdown-lesson-applies">Rule #1: All of the Markdown syntax you learned from the Getting Started with Markdown lesson applies!</h3>
<p>You should follow this basic syntax when writing your Digital Tools Assignments.</p>

<h3 id="rule-2-post-titles">Rule #2: Post Titles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The title of your post in your post’s header will display on our blog; no need to use that same title in the post itself. You may want to open with a subtitle, and that’s fine (like, for example, “Introduction” or something), but you don’t need to repeat your post’s main title in the body of your post. It looks redundant on the blog!</li>
  <li>No colons in the post titles you create in your header. Colons confuse the Jekyll convertor and it doesn’t know what to do with your post. Just use a dash instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: post
author: Melissa Reynolds
excerpt_separator: &lt;!--more--&gt;
title: Academics Cannot Write Titles Without Colons: A Study
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Better to write this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: post
author: Melissa Reynolds
excerpt_separator: &lt;!--more--&gt;
title: Academics Can Write Titles Without Colons - But Only in Markdown
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="rule-3-use--or-smaller-for-your-subheadings-and-subtitles-within-your-posts-not-">Rule #3: Use ## or smaller for your subheadings and subtitles within your posts, not #.</h3>
<p>This rule is strictly aesthetic. The CSS style sheet for our site renders your post titles as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h2&gt;</code> in HTML, which means that any subheadings in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;</code> look disproportionate. Again, this is an aesthetic rule just for our course blog, not one that applies to any other places you might use Markdown!</p>

<h3 id="rule-3-embedding-aligning-and-resizing-an-image">Rule #3: Embedding, aligning, and resizing an image.</h3>
<p>I’ve added some CSS to our style sheet to make this possible on our  course website. The basic CSS that comes in Jekyll-ready templates doesn’t include the ability to resize images or align them unless you insert HTML or directly load the file into an “images” folder in your repository. Here’s what you do:</p>

<p>Follow the usual syntax for embedding an image using Markdown, just like always, but add the following extra stuff at the end:<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![Alt text](https://linktoimage.jpg){:width=”450px” .center-image}</code></p>

<p>You can of course change the pixel value to whatever you’d like, but be sure it’s in quotation marks. You can also use the following commands to align your image to the left or right and float your text around your image:</p>

<p>For left aligned: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![Alt text](https://linktoimage.jpg){:width=”450px” .left-image}</code></p>

<p>For right aligned: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![Alt text](https://linktoimage.jpg){:width=”450px” .right-image}</code></p>

<p>Note that when your image is center aligned, your text will appear underneath the image and will not float around it. When you use right or left aligned, the image will be nestled within a text block.</p>

<p>Now that we know how to do this, best practices for embedding images within your post would be to always use a URL rather than a file.
If you must download a photo to use it, host it on your personal GitHub account in a public repository, but not the one you forked from HUM-331-Princeton (because then when you send a pull request it will merge into our class repository). Once the image is hosted publicly on GitHub, you can simply right click the image and copy the link address.</p>

<h3 id="rule-4-setting-an-excerpt-for-your-post-to-be-displayed-on-our-home-page">Rule #4: Setting an “excerpt” for your post to be displayed on our home page.</h3>
<p>In its default mode, Jekyll automatically selects the first paragraph of your post as an “excerpt” that will be displayed on the home page of our blog, followed by a link to READ MORE.
Sometimes, though, it doesn’t work like it’s supposed to, or maybe you want to include a bit more in the preview that readers see on our course home page, like an image or a longer section of text.
If so, you can simple add this to your posts header material:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: post
Author: Your Name
excerpt_separator: &lt;!--more--&gt;
Title: Your Post Title
---
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, in the body of your post, wherever you want the post to break on the home page and link to <strong>READ MORE</strong>, you insert that symbol exactly: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!--more--&gt;</code></p>

<h3 id="rule-5-be-aware-of--cropping-up-in-citations">Rule #5: Be aware of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> cropping up in citations</h3>
<p>Many of you included a “Works Cited” section in your last Digital Tools Assignment, which is great. But, by default, it’s pretty common for a website title to look like this, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1756: Nassau Hall | Princetoniana Museum,</code> with a vertical line separating the page name from the site name. Unfortunately, this vertical line is the same symbol used in Markdown to indicate that you want to display information in a table format. You’ll end up with text that has weird spacing in the middle of the line, and it’ll look funky in your post. Best to convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> into “–” to fix this problem.</p>
