<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Students will read between 50â€“100 pages per week from secondary sources (i.e. scholarly books and articles). All of our readings are available online, either via the Firestone libraryâ€™s digital subscriptions or via our course Canvas.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation--grading">Evaluation &amp; Grading</h2>
<p>Attendance and participation in our seminar discussions is mandatory. Grades will be awarded according to History Department criteria, reproduced at the end of the syllabus. More than two absences from class sessions without contacting the instructor and providing explanation (and documentation of illness, when necessary) will result in 5 point reduction from your final grade for every class period missed.</p>

<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>Participation is a critical component of this course. Students are expected to come to class having done the reading and ready to engage in class discussion. Engagement includes both active listening to your fellow studentsâ€™ viewpoints and careful articulation of your own ideas. If you tend to be a talker, please share your thoughts but be sure to make room for others. If you tend to be quiet, know that your voice is essential in our classroom. You will always show respect for your fellow students, even when you disagree with their ideas.</p>

<h2 id="late-work">Late Work</h2>
<p>Ten points will be deducted from the final grade of an assignment for every day the assignment is late. Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted. If you have an emergency or extenuating circumstance that may prevent you from completing your work on time, you should be sure to communicate these concerns with me well in advance of the assignmentâ€™s due date.</p>

<h2 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h2>
<p>All student work should meet the requirements of the Universityâ€™s Honor Code, and all papers will include the honor pledge on the title page, signed by the student.</p>

<h2 id="accommodations-for-disabilities">Accommodations for Disabilities</h2>
<p>Students must register with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) (<a href="mailto:ods@princeton.edu">ods@princeton.edu</a>; 258-8840) for disability verification and determination of eligibility for reasonable academic accommodations. Requests for academic accommodations for this course need to be made at the beginning of the semester, or as soon as possible for newly approved students, and again at least two weeks in advance of any needed accommodations in order to make arrangements to implement the accommodations. Please make an appointment to meet with me in order to maintain confidentiality in addressing your needs. No accommodations will be given without authorization from ODS, or without advance notice.</p>
