I"$<p>How do the methods, materials, and technologies of human communication shape religion,
politics, popular culture, and the circulation of knowledge? Can we tie the invention of
writing to the origins of cities? Would the ‘religions of the book’ have flourished in
the Middle Ages without the invention of the codex? Is it true that the printing press
made the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution possible? And did newspapers really
encourage the Age of Revolutions? Students tackled these questions as they traced the
history of human communication from its origins in the ancient Near East to its diffusion
over the World Wide Web. Weekly units zoomed in on ‘revolutions’ within the history of
communication to highlight how ‘new’ technologies of communication often spur broader
cultural and societal change.</p>

In addition to weekly thematic lectures and readings on the history of communication,
students engaged with new digital methods of historical research and archival
preservation. Students learned how our latest revolution in communication–the emergence
of digital languages, interfaces, and platforms–has transformed how historians and
archivists preserve and interact with the material evidence of communication in the past.
In weekly “digital labs,” students explored cutting-edge digital archives to analyze the
influence of the digital on the work of history, while also trying their hands at the
digital tools that are making new kinds of historical research possible.</p>

<p>This digital humanities course, developed with a David A. Gardner ‘69 Magic Grant from the Humanities Council at Princeton University, combines a history of communication technologies with hands-on exploration of the communication technologies reshaping the discipline of history. Using GitHub, Jekyll, Markdown, and a variety of “digital tools” introduced throughout the semester, students create digital work that they share on our course site.</p>
