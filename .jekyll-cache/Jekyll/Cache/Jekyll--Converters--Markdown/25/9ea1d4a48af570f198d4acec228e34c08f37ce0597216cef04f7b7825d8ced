I"»<p>How do the methods, materials, and technologies of human communication shape religion,
politics, popular culture, and the circulation of knowledge? Can we tie the invention of
writing to the origins of cities? Would the â€˜religions of the bookâ€™ have flourished in
the Middle Ages without the invention of the codex? Is it true that the printing press
made the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution possible? And did newspapers really
encourage the Age of Revolutions? We will tackle these questions as we trace the
history of human communication from its origins in the ancient Near East to its diffusion
over the World Wide Web. Weekly units will zoom in on â€˜revolutionsâ€™ within the history of
communication to highlight how â€˜newâ€™ technologies of communication often spur broader
cultural and societal change.</p>

In addition to weekly thematic lectures and readings on the history of communication,
you will try your hands at new digital methods of historical research and archival
preservation. Together, and with visits from digital humanists working on projects in and around Princeton, weâ€™ll examine how our latest revolution in communicationâ€“the emergence
of digital languages, interfaces, and platformsâ€“has transformed how historians and
archivists preserve and interact with the material evidence of communication in the past.</p>
