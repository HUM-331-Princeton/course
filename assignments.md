## Digital Tools Assignment #1: Getting Started with Markdown

In this assignment you will compose a blog post discussing a possible resource held in Princeton University's Special Collections that you might work with for your final project. Instructions for the assignment can be found here.

## Digital Tools Assignment #2: StoryMaps or TimeMapper

In this assignment you'll use your digital source selected from Princeton's Special Collections and research its context in order to create either a StoryMap or TimeMapper related to the source. Instructions for the assignment can be found here.

## Digital Tools Assignment #3: XML and TEI

In this assignment, you'll select a text from your research or from a historical source that interests you and encode it with XML using categories in-keeping with the Text Encoding Initiative standards. You'll imagine what a future reader might want to discover from your chosen text and develop a tagging schema to render it into useable data.

## Digital Tools Assignment #4: Cytoscape

In this assignment, you will create a dataset of at least 100 nodes which you will input into Cytoscape for network visualization and analysis. Your dataset may be one we discuss in class, or it may be one that pertains to your final project's primary source.
