  <h1>Getting Ready for our Final Projects</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>The first thing we’re going to do is download and install <strong>Atom</strong>, my favorite text editor for working directly with GitHub. It’s got Git built into it and will sync easily with your GitHub account.</p>

<h2 id="to-be-done-before-class-on-wednesday-march-31">To be done before class on Wednesday, March 31:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://atom.io">atom.io</a>. Click Download.</li>
  <li>Once Atom is downloaded, double click to unzip the file. If you’re on a Mac, you’ll need to open your Downloads folder and move Atom into your Applications folder.</li>
  <li>Open the application by double clicking it.</li>
  <li>If you don’t already have developer command line tools installed on your computer, you may see a dialogue box pop up that says: “The ‘git’ command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?”</li>
  <li>Click Install and agree to the licensing terms to Install XCode. Click Install, not Get XCode, if that’s an option you see.</li>
  <li>When you open Atom, you’ll see a menu at the bottom right. Click GitHub. You’ll be asked to go to github.com to sign in and get a code to link Atom with your account.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great, you’ve got Atom! We’ll work in Atom in class on Wednesday, so you’re all set for now.</p>

<h2 id="to-work-through-in-class-on-wednesday-march-31">To work through in class on Wednesday, March 31:</h2>

<p>Now we’re going to head over to GitHub, to the <a href="https:://github.com/HUM-331-Princeton">HUM-331-Princeton repository</a>. You’ll see a new repository in the organization: <strong>HUM-331-Princeton/final-project-template</strong>.</p>

<p>I created this template for you all to use for your final project, but it’s really just a copy of a pretty popular (and really user-friendly) Jekyll template known as Jekyll Now that I’ve customized with a sidebar navigation and a contributors template. It is a very basic website that you can customize with extra HTML or CSS if you’d like, but it also functions really simply right out of the gate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the repository final-project-template.</li>
  <li>If you’re working with a classmate as a pair for your final project, <em>just one of you</em> should click Use this template to create a new repository based on exactly these files.</li>
  <li>Be sure to select HUM-331-Princeton as the owner of the repository, not your personal account.</li>
  <li>Decide what you want to call the repository, and keep in mind that this will end up in the URL for your site, so pick something that conveys a bit about your project but keep it short—like no more than three words at most.</li>
  <li>Add a description that says something about the site and your project, and select Public.</li>
  <li>Navigate to <strong>Pages</strong> in the sidebar menu, and select <strong>main</strong> in the drop down menu. Keep the source as <strong>/(root)</strong> and click Save.</li>
  <li>In the left-hand menu, navigate to <strong>Manage Access</strong>. Whichever one of you created the new repository, invite the other member of your group by typing their GitHub account name into the box. Be sure to select <strong>Admin</strong> as that person’s privileges in the repository.</li>
  <li>In the left-hand menu, navigate to <strong>Notifications</strong> and enter your email addresses.</li>
  <li>Give it a few seconds (or maybe a minute or two) and direct your browser to HUM-331-Princeton.github.io/whatever-you-named-your-repository
You should see a bare bones demo site, ready for you to customize!</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, you’ve created a site, that’s awesome!</p>

<p><strong>Now it’s time to put the files on your local computer so you can work on your final project without constantly clicking around GitHub. We’re going back to Atom.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Atom and click the GitHub menu at the bottom right.</li>
  <li>You should see a menu option to “Clone an existing GitHub repository…”</li>
  <li>Click that option, and you’ll see a box pop up with a space for you to paste in the URL of your new repository.</li>
  <li>Go back to GitHub.com and copy the URL for your new repository. This is the GitHub URL not the URL for your new site. So it should be:
github.com/HUM-331-Princeton/whatever-you-named-your-project</li>
  <li>Now paste that address into the box and pay attention to where it’s getting saved in your computer. Atom will automatically create a file on your computer called github, but it won’t be in your Documents or Desktop unless you specify that location. If I wanted the folder to be in Documents, I would need to edit the path for the repository files to: Users/melissareynolds/Documents/github/whatever-you-named-your-site.</li>
  <li>Click Clone and you should see all the files from your new repository appear!</li>
  <li>Edit your <strong>config.yml</strong> file with your site title, description, and updated url. <strong>This will only be done once.</strong></li>
  <li>Save those changes. Toggle the <strong>git</strong> menu on the bottom right. You’ll see the file <strong>config.yml</strong> in the <strong>Unstaged Changes</strong> list.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Stage All</strong> and see the <strong>config.yml</strong> file move down to the <strong>Staged Changes</strong> box. Type in a <strong>commit message</strong> and click <strong>Commit to main</strong>.</li>
  <li>At the bottom right menu, click <strong>push</strong>. You’ve now sent your changes to the remote repository!</li>
  <li>From now on you’ll work in your own branch, rather than in the <strong>main</strong> branch so that you and your partner can make changes without cancelling each other’s work out. Click <strong>main</strong> and click <strong>New branch</strong>.</li>
  <li>Type in the name of your branch as <strong>firstname–MM-DD</strong> and then click <strong>New Branch</strong> again. You’ve got your own branch now and you can get to work!</li>
</ol>
